- The **navbar** should contain **a** elements with the class of **nav-link**. There should be one for every element with the class **main-section**.
 - The **header** element in the navbar must come before any **a** elements in the navbar.
- Each element with the class of **nav-link** should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section.
- Clicking on a **navbar** element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the **main-doc** element .

## üìî Commits Guidelines

- Using as reference [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Every commit should have a sign with the contributor's GPG key
- The basic structure should be `[{ type in uppercase }] { description using imperative writing style or writing as a if it were a command }"`, for example:
  - `[UPDATE] header component with a new one more darker`
- For the types we have:
  - `[UPDATE]` : when we need to add a new feature, tests or change a property.
  - `[FIX]` : to implement the code necessary to fix a problem.
  - `[DELETE]` : when a file is going to be deleted and not replaced.
  - `[BREAKING CHANGE] or !` : to implement changes that are going to affect the integration with other services, for example:
    - `[UPDATE]! API version to v2 for new endpoints`

##  ü§ù How to Contribute

1. Create a new branch using as base the `dev` branch.
2. Do the necessary improvements and make a commit: `git commit -S -am "{commit message}"` or use `git add .` and then `git commit -S -m "{commit message}"`.
3. Upload changes to the repository: `git push origin <branch name>`.
4. Create a pull request to the `dev` branch.
5. Wait for the code review and the merge.
6. Now your changes are in the dev environment.
7. After a review your changes are going to be merged to the `master` branch.
8. For certain contributors there are exeptions to these steps.
